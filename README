libreport
---------

Generic library for reporting various problems to destinations like mailing
lists, regular files, remote servers and bug tracking tools.

The library operates on problem data stored in the form of regular files in
a directory (so called dump directory).

The library provides a low level API (dump_dir.h) for creating and modifying
dump directories, a high level API allowing to avoid the need to work with dump
directories (problem_data.h), and a set of tools that file reports.

The library also provides an infrastructure (run_event.h, report_event.conf)
for automatic execution of shell scripts working with dump directories.
